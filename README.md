# emu8080
Another college student trying to make an 8080 emulator. I'll probably be mostly following emulator101 for this, and I intend to eventually extend it into a z80 emulator + support for most gameboy games.

I've also invited my frinds to help contribute with me. But we shall see how enthusiastic they are. (Its also motivation for me to see this to the end)
This is mostly just an academic exercize to me, and a chance to maintain a non-trivial c++ program

Here are some links to some resource that we'll probably need. I would just upload them to the repo but you never know how protective some people are for the data sheets of 40 year old hardware.
